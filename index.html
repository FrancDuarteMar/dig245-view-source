                    Want to see what you're downloading? Check out the
                    <code>Network</code> tab in the console. Here you can also
                    download files when a website doesn't provide a download
                    button. Use it responsibly!

                </li>
                <li>
                    Want to make a quick change to the website? You can also do
                    that from the console! Just launch the dev tools/inspect
                    element and head over to the <code>elements</code> tab and
                    start changing things! Here you can change everything
                    including text colors, content and other visual attributes
                    that appears on the site!

                    Want to see what the current website looks like on a
                    different device or do you just want to trick the website
                    into thinking you're on a phone? You can do that by
                    selecting the <code> Device Emulation</code>button available
                    on some browsers like Microsoft Edge.
                    <br>

                    From here, you can control the size of the webpage on the
                    left of your developer tools. For some websites, you can do
                    special tasks that can only be done on mobile and for
                    others, you can see live changes as you resize the selected
                    area without the need to change your window view!

                Think of this like looking at the insides of your body or taking
                apart a computer. You can see everything that happens inside of
                the websites you visit!

                    website</a>! Open up the developer tools or look at the
